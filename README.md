# Peer-graded-Assignment-Competing-GPUs
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a GPU twist. You play against an AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm, while the program actively forces GPU activity (via CUDA kernels) and tracks real GPU utilization in real time.

Features

✅ Classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a Tkinter GUI

✅ Minimax algorithm ensures the GPU opponent plays optimally

✅ CUDA GPU activity triggered during moves (via Numba)

✅ GPU utilization monitoring (using nvidia-smi)

✅ Automatic frame capture of the GUI (with Pillow)

✅ Option to save the game session as a video (.mp4)

✅ Robust fallback: if CUDA is unavailable, the game still works in CPU-only mode

Installation

Clone the repository
```

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-gpu.git

cd tic-tac-toe-gpu
```

Set up Python environment
```
pip install numpy

pip install tk

pip install pillow

pip install imageio

pip install matplotlib

pip install numba
```
Usage

Run the game:
```
python CUDA_Competing_GPUs.py
```
Gameplay

You are X

The GPU opponent is O

Click on the grid to make your move

The GPU opponent will respond optimally

Technical Highlights

CUDA Integration
Uses Numba @cuda.jit kernels for GPU activity

Warm-up kernel to stabilize CUDA context

AI Opponent
Implements minimax algorithm with depth-based scoring

Guarantees optimal play (impossible to beat if you play randomly)

GUI & Multimedia
Tkinter for game board

PIL.ImageGrab for frame capturing

ImageIO for video compilation
